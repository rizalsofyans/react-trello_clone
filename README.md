## Trello Clone with React.js

Hey there! Welcome to my repository, where I'm diving deep into the world of React.js and beyond.

So, what's on my learning agenda, you ask? Well, buckle up because I've got quite the itinerary planned out:

1. **Styling with styled-components**: Say goodbye to dull, static stylesheets and hello to dynamic and component-based styling! With styled-components, I'm exploring the power of CSS-in-JS to create visually stunning and responsive user interfaces.

2. **Fetching & Saving data**: Ah, the magic of data manipulation! From fetching data from external APIs to saving user input in databases, I'm honing my skills in handling data seamlessly within React applications.

3. **Custom Hooks**: Who doesn't love a good shortcut? Custom Hooks are like the secret sauce of React development, allowing me to encapsulate logic and reuse it across multiple components. It's like having a toolbox full of handy shortcuts for building efficient and maintainable code.

4. **Drag and Drop**: Let's add some interactivity to the mix! With drag-and-drop functionality, I'm exploring ways to enhance user experience by allowing users to effortlessly rearrange elements on the screen. It's like playing a game of digital Tetris, but with a lot more flexibility and creativity.

5. **Higher Order Components (HOC)**: Time to level up my component game! HOCs are like the Swiss Army knives of React, enabling me to enhance and extend the functionality of my components without cluttering up their core logic. It's all about maximizing reusability and composability to build robust and scalable applications.

So, as you can see, I've got my hands full with a diverse array of topics to explore and master. But hey, that's what makes this journey so exciting, right? There's always something new to learn and discover in the ever-evolving world of web development! ðŸš€
